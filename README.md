# Solver for many-body boson systems (WIP)

Software for exact diagonalization of contact interaction bosons in 2D cylinder,
density matrix diagonalization, positions drawing, self-consistent solving special case of 
GPE for centered vortex in cylinder. Currenty working on simple BdG solver fot vortex state from GPE.

* Many body calculations are being done with Fock state basis consisting of single particle states that are solutions of single particle Schr√∂dinger equation (Bessel functions).
* Many body function is used to determine density matrix (this we can compare to mean-field solutions).
* Density matrix can be used to draw positions of particles one-by-one.
* Solving GPE equation with centered vortex can be done very precisly using 1st bessel function and its zeros.
* Solution to GPE from previous points can be used in BdG equation (WIP).

In the code states are heandled in different ways, for single-particle:
* Eigenstates of single-particle Hamiltonian (Bessel's with phase factor) are reference using indexes from 0,
  call state_info(state_nr) to get StateInfo structure with additional information about given state.
* Basis:     Holds indexes to single-particle states.
* State:     Holds Basis and coefficients of linear combination of them.

And for many-body we use structures:
* Fock:      Eigenstates of many-body Hamiltonian without interaction.
* FockBasis: Holds many 'Fock' (not linear combination, just array of different states)
* FockState: Holds FockBasis and coefficients of linear combination of them.
